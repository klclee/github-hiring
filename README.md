github-hiring
=============

Small project to see if it is possible to hire great developers from github/stackover flow data and the likes. Not even sure if I have a lot of time to build this but is itch i have so will add my thinking here as time permits.

* [problem using oure github data](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2763182)
* using stack exhange API too. if user have a good commits to a particular githib project they should also have good contribution against those langauge project. Problem here could be traction? Since you need users to hook up to both at signup.
* Alternativly we can ask the potential hire question git from stack on that particular stack.
